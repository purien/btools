Tools for Blockchains Transaction Generation for Crypto Currency Bitcoin and Ethereum
Optionally Secured by a Crypto Currency Smartcard (CCSC)

BTOOLS is an open software available for WINDOWS and LINUX, which generates transactions for Bitcoin and Ethereum crypto currency platforms. It is based on the OPENSSL library. In order to provide a strong security, it supports a dedicated Crypto Currency SmartCard (CCSC) uses to generate and store secret keys, and to compute cryptographic (ECDSA) signature.

BTOOLS provides the following services:
- Bitcoin address generation (mainnet and testnet);
- Ethereum address generation;
- Bitcoin transaction generation;
- Ethereum transaction generation;
- Simple Bitcoin node client;
- Bitcoin transaction (via the Bitcoin client);
- Ethereum transaction (via WEB APIs);
- Crypto Currency SmartCard scripts for key generation and transaction signature.

This software, allows a user to electronically sign documents. It first allows the user to generate a private/public key pair (the user signature) and to store the private key on a smartcardâ€™s secure element, for use in the next step, which is the document signature. The Ethertrust company (www.ethertrust.com) can provide the smartcard.
